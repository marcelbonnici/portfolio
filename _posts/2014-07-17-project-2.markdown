description: <h3>Project Overview</h3> To achieve every student’s dream, I created a homework machine to read worksheets and reveal their answers. As a ten-week assignment, problems were limited to simple multiplication problems, called “times tables” in many US schools, where third grade students multiply whole numbers inclusively between 0 and 12. The core project components were: <ul><li>LEGO prototype for projecting the machine’s plausibility</li><li>Tesseract for transcribing image files to text</li><li>OpenCV for visualizing Tesseract’s bounding boxes and for overlaying answers on the photocopy</li><li>Microcontroller for operating the scanner and conversing with the Python code via serial</li>The input and output iteration flowchart explains the order of the program:<br> <br>
