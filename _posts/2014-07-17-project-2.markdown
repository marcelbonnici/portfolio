description: <h3>Project Overview</h3> To achieve every student’s dream, I created a homework machine to read worksheets and reveal their answers. As a ten-week assignment, problems were limited to simple multiplication problems, called “times tables” in many US schools, where third grade students multiply whole numbers inclusively between 0 and 12. The core project components were LEGO prototype for projecting the machine’s plausibility, Tesseract for transcribing image files to text, OpenCV for visualizing Tesseract’s bounding boxes and for overlaying answers on the photocopy, Microcontroller for operating the scanner and conversing with the Python code via serial.
