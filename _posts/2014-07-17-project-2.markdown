description: <h3>Project Overview</h3> To achieve every student’s dream, I created a homework machine to read worksheets and reveal their answers. As a ten-week assignment, problems were limited to simple multiplication problems, called “times tables” in many US schools, where third grade students multiply whole numbers inclusively between 0 and 12. <br> <br> The core project components were a LEGO prototype for projecting the machine’s plausibility, Tesseract for transcribing image files to text, OpenCV for visualizing Tesseract’s bounding boxes/overlaying answers on the photocopy, and a microcontroller for operating the scanner and conversing with the Python code via serial. <br> <br> The input and output iteration explains the order of the program. <br> <br> <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1M9WZYq9qzs-bMXmwQGeoRdOI0mvVhkou"> <h3>LEGO Prototype</h3> As a serious LEGO artist, I built an XY plotter capable of writing any numbers through slight code modifications. Hitting a push button caused a motor to pull in a worksheet, moving the vertical axis. Another motor moved a conveyor belt, sliding an attached pen to traverse the horizontal axis. A third motor controlled a cam, consequently lifting and lowering the pen between characters. <h3>Tesseract</h3> The library’s image_to_boxes function returned bounding box locations for characters found in the worksheet’s digital photocopy. Contextual methods for finding text were bypassed by selecting a specific page segmentation method. Consequently, I made my own sorting algorithm to find neighboring characters. From here, identifying an expression by spotting the multiplication sign, “x”, preceded and proceeded by two, nearby numbers was performed. <br> <br><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cxeyPx4pvbMLjA_l-tTx6RoYmcU-0N8e" width="795" height="27"> <h3>OpenCV</h3>
