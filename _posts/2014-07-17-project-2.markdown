description: <h3>Project Overview</h3> To achieve every student’s dream, I created a homework machine to read worksheets and reveal their answers. As a ten-week assignment, problems were limited to simple multiplication problems, called “times tables” in many US schools, where third grade students multiply whole numbers inclusively between 0 and 12. <br> <br> The core project components were a LEGO prototype for projecting the machine’s plausibility, Tesseract for transcribing image files to text, OpenCV for visualizing Tesseract’s bounding boxes/overlaying answers on the photocopy, and a microcontroller for operating the scanner and conversing with the Python code via serial. <br> <br> The input and output iteration explains the order of the program. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1M9WZYq9qzs-bMXmwQGeoRdOI0mvVhkou" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> <br> <h3>LEGO Prototype</h3> The
