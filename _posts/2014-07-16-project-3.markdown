description: Exploring rapidly-growing random trees, or RRTs, served the last challenge in Northwestern University’s MS Robotics Hackathon orientation. An RRT is a means of generating random paths, and with obstacles in mind, avoids them to ideally reach an end coordinate. The challenge was intended to help students grow familiar with Python while exercising a phenomenon common in robot path navigation. After coding an RRT without a destination, which was followed by coding an RRT that navigates around circle obstacles, the last task yielded an RRT navigating around Northwestern University’s N logo to connect a start and end point. See the assignment description at <a href="http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~elwin/">RRT Layout</a> and the code at the <a href="https://github.com/marcelbonnici/rrt">GitHub repository</a>
